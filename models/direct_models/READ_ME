Models trained for direct regression: prediction a single P(n,m) given parameter vector and n,m values. 

Models: 
* 256 nodes, 2,3,4,5 layers
* 3 layers, 128,256,512,1024,and 3000 nodes
* final model chosen based on above parameters, trained on more examples: direct_256u_3l_4t_MODEL



All model meta data stored in .npy files with same name as MODEL files.
